## Thoughts

It was relatively easy to setup this basic API. I would have to start converting this to use Tables/Entities.
I ended up following the instructions here for Cake 3.6 Cookbook on REST - https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/development/rest.html

It took me about an hour or two of on and off playing with cake to get this basic REST api going.
