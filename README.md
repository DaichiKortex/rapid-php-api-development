# Rapid PHP API Development

Mash up of various PHP Frameworks to quickly build a RESTful API. In each example I've stood up a skeleton project and got the bare minimum done to store a "Note" in a database via CRUD calls to a json API. I didn't write tests but I did regression test the basic calls. 

You can checkout the slides at [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yAbHhvnf0-xE2kUH3FF4K2WuX7Mn8SkiirDYFclhMtg/edit?usp=sharing).

I've stood up the following in this repo:

* CakePHP
* Laravel
* Lumen
* Symfony Flex
* Vanilla PHP
* Zend 3
* Zend Expressive

I used PHP 7.2 with various extensions to support each framework. I dropped Mysql 5.7 along side to connect to. I'm on Ubuntu 18.04 and googled my way to victory to get everything installed.

## Other Frameworks

There are just too many possible Frameworks out there to cover so here is a list of others that are used in the wild.
